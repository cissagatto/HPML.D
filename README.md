## Preparing your experiment

### STEP 1
A file called _datasets-original.csv_ must be in the *root project directory*. This file is used to read information about the datasets and they are used in the code. We have 90 multilabel datasets in this _.csv_ file. If you want to use another dataset, please, add the following information about the dataset in the file:


| Parameter    | Status    | Description                                           |

### STEP 2: Cross-Validation Files
The experiment requires pre-processed cross-validation files in `.tar.gz` format. You can download the 10-fold files for multilabel datasets [here](https://1drv.ms/u/s!Aq6SGcf6js1mrZJSkZ3VEJ217rEd5A?e=IH73m3).

For new datasets, you can generate these files by following the instructions in [this repository](https://github.com/cissagatto/crossvalidationmultilabel). After generating the files, place the `.tar.gz` archive in any directory, and provide the absolute path in the configuration file for the `global.R` script.



### STEP 3
You will need the previously best chosen partitions by one of the following codes:

- https://github.com/cissagatto/Best-Hybrid-Partition (beeing implemented)

- https://github.com/cissagatto/Best-Partition-Silhouette

- https://github.com/cissagatto/Best-Partition-MaF1

- https://github.com/cissagatto/Best-Partition-MiF1


You must use here the results generated from the *OUTPUT* directory in that source code. They must be compressed into a *TAR.GZ* file and placed in a directory on your computer. The absolute path of this directory must be passed as a parameter in the configuration file. Please see the configuration file example in this source code (config-files directory).




### STEP 4
You need to have installed all the Java, Python and R packages required to execute this code on your machine or server. This code does not provide any type of automatic package installation!

You can use the [Conda Environment](https://1drv.ms/u/s!Aq6SGcf6js1mw4hbhU9Raqarl8bH8Q?e=IA2aQs) that I created to perform this experiment. Below are the links to download the files. Try to use the command below to extract the environment to your computer:

```
conda env create -file AmbienteTeste.yaml
```

See more information about Conda environments [here](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html) 

You can also run this code using the AppTainer [container](https://1drv.ms/u/s!Aq6SGcf6js1mw4hcVuz_IN8_Bh1oFQ?e=5NuyxX) that I'm using to run this code in a SLURM cluster. Please, check this [tutorial](https://rpubs.com/cissagatto/apptainer-slurm-r) (in portuguese) to see how to do that. 


### STEP 5
To run this code you will need a configuration file saved in *csv* format and with the following information:

| Config          | Value                                                                         | 
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------| 
| FolderScripts   | Absolute path to the R folder scripts                                         |
| Dataset_Path    | Absolute path to the directory where the dataset's tar.gz is stored           |
| Temporary_Path  | Absolute path to the directory where temporary processing will be performed*  |
| Partitions_Path | Absolute path to the directory where the best partitions are                  |
| Implementation  | Must be "clus" or "rf"                                                        |
| Dendrogram      | The linkage metric that were used to built the dendrogram:                    |
|                 | - single, complete, average, ward.D, ward.D2 or mcQuitty                      |
| Similarity      | Must be "jaccard", "rogers" or another similarity measure                     |
| Criteria        | Must be "maf1" to test the best partition chosen with Macro-F1,               |
|                 | "mif1" to test the best partition chosen with Micro-F1,                       |
|                 | or "silho" to test the best partition chosen with Silhouette Coefficient      |
| Dataset_Name    | Dataset name according to *datasets-original.csv* file                        |
| Number_Dataset  | Dataset number according to *datasets-original.csv* file                      |
| Number_Folds    | Number of folds used in cross validation                                      |
| Number_Cores    | Number of cores for parallel processing                                       |

* Use directorys like */dev/shm*, *tmp* or *scratch* here.

You can save configuration files wherever you want. The absolute path will be passed as a command line argument.



## üõ†Ô∏è Software Requirements

- Python 3.10
- Conda 24.11.3

## üíª Hardware Recommendations
This code may or may not be executed in parallel, however, it is highly recommended that you run it in parallel. The number of cores can be configured via the command line (number_cores). If number_cores = 1 the code will run sequentially. In our experiments, we used 10 cores. For reproducibility, we recommend that you also use ten cores. This code was tested with the emotions dataset in the following machine:

- Linux 6.11.0-26-generic #26~24.04.1-Ubuntu SMP PREEMPT_DYNAMIC x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux
- Distributor ID: Ubuntu, Description: Ubuntu 24.04.2 LTS, Release: 24.04, Codename: noble
- Manufacturer: Acer, Product Name: Nitro ANV15-51, Version: V1.16, Wake-up Type: Power Switch, Family: Acer Nitro V 15

Then the experiment was executed in a cluster at UFSC (Federal University of Santa Catarina Campus Blumenau).



## Results
The results are stored in the _REPORTS_ directory.
